# GOV.UK One Login Frontend UI â€“ Browser Tests

This directory contains Playwright-based browser tests for visual regression and functional validation of GOV.UK One Login frontend UI components.

## Structure

- **functional-tests/**  
  Contains Playwright test files for each UI component, as well as their corresponding visual regression snapshot folders.
  - `CookieBanner.visual.test.ts`  
    Tests the Cookie Banner component, including default, accepted, and rejected states.
  - `Footer.visual.test.ts`  
    Tests the Footer component's visual appearance.
  - `Header.visual.test.ts`  
    Tests the Header component, including sign-out interactions.
  - `LanguageSelect.visual.test.ts`  
    Tests the Language Select component in English and Welsh.
  - `PhaseBanner.visual.test.ts`  
    Tests the Phase Banner component.
  - `SkipLink.visual.test.ts`  
    Tests the Skip Link component, including full-page screenshots.

  Each test file has a corresponding `*-snapshots/` folder containing images generated during visual regression tests.

## Running Tests

To run all browser tests:

```sh
npm run test:visual
```

To update visual regression snapshots:

```sh
npm run test:visual:update
```

## Adding New Tests

1. Create a new `.visual.test.ts` file in `functional-tests/` for your component.
2. Use Playwright's `expect(...).toHaveScreenshot(...)` to generate and compare snapshots.
3. Snapshots will be saved in a folder named `<Component>.visual.test.ts-snapshots/`.

## Notes

- Ensure your local server is running at `http://localhost:3000/welcome` before running tests.
- Snapshots are platform-specific (e.g., `*-darwin.png` for macOS).
